Company Flight Policy: Passenger Punctuality and Attendance

Check-In & Boarding Times

Passengers are required to complete check-in at least 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure for domestic flights and 90 minutes prior for international flights.

Boarding gates close 15 minutes before departure. Once gates are closed, no further boarding will be permitted.

Late Arrivals

Any passenger arriving after the gate closure will be marked as a no-show.

No-shows are non-refundable and non-transferable, except in cases where the airline is responsible for the delay.

Passengers with valid documentation of delays (e.g., traffic accidents, medical emergencies) may request special review, but approval is not guaranteed.

Missed Connections

If a connecting flight is missed due to a delay caused by the airline, the passenger will be rebooked on the next available flight at no additional cost.

If the connection is missed due to passenger tardiness, rebooking fees will apply and seat availability is not guaranteed.

Special Circumstances

In cases of severe weather, natural disasters, or operational disruptions, the airline may waive rebooking fees and provide accommodation where required.

Emergency travel purposes (e.g., medical or family emergencies) may qualify for flexible handling at the discretion of airline staff.

Responsibilities of the Passenger

It is the sole responsibility of the passenger to allow sufficient time for traffic, security screening, and check-in.

The airline strongly recommends passengers arrive at the airport 2 hours prior to domestic flights and 3 hours prior to international flights to avoid complications.
